            <p class="project-description">In The Handover, Aly Eissa, Ayman Asfour and Jonas Cambien explore the common and uncommon senses of Egypt's ritual music. It is clear that Aly Eissa's original composition is deeply rooted in Egyptian and Arabic traditions. At the same time, this band is one of the most progressive coming out of Egypt today. This is in big part thanks to Eissa, who has proven time and again to be not only an extremely skillful composer but also a real visionary, combining tradition with modern experimentation.

            <p class="project-description">Eissa to Asfour is a documentation and celebration of the musical companionship between Aly Eissa (oud) and Ayman Asfour (violin). Aly and Ayman first began playing together in 2017 and since then, they have had the opportunity to play many live concerts together in Egypt and throughout Europe, as well as record together on several albums. Aly and Ayman, despite coming from two different generations, share a mutual passion for classical Arabic and Egyptian folk music. At the same time, they both enjoy experimenting with contemporary approaches to improvisation and creating sounds. This album celebrates this close and dynamic friendship and documents the chemistry between these two musicians and their way of creating a unique contemporary Egyptian folk sound.</p>
